# bluetooth-low-energy

The aim of this project is to gain solid practical understanding of Bluetooth low energy: the protocol, how data is organized, and the key design trade-offs that were made in the creation of the protocol. 

## As part of this learning experience:

* Build Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) firmware for different use cases on Cortex M4F device
* Create custom Services and Characteristics
* Understand the complete BLE stack
* Build Bluetooth Low Energy embedded devices

This project is in progress. I will keep posting the updates.
